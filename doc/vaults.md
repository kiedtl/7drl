# Treasure vaults

Inspired by TGGW's Golden and Stone Rooms, treasure vaults in Oathbreaker
provide the potential of high-value loot, with the downside of being possibly
forced to fight all manner of deadly OOD-monsters. Before opening the vault's
doors (which will be invariably closed), you'll have to decide whether the
possibility of finding yourself in melee range with extremely dangerous enemies
is worth the chance of getting some great equipment. It's unlikely you'll
accidentally enter one, however, as treasure vaults always generate with
distinct walls, and the game will warn you before you enter one. **If in doubt,
don't open them.** They are completely optional.

**Vault generation**:
- More than one vault cannot generate on a floor.
- Many, but not all, floors will have one vault.
- Treasure vaults can generate on the lowest floors, but opening one so soon is
  almost certainly suicidal.

**Tips** for raiding a vault:
- Be prepared for some deadly ranged attacks from spires or spellcasters.
- Ensure you can use AoE consumables (!paralyse, !confuse, !poison) if needed.
- Once again, remember that you *do not* have to kill every monster inside.
  - Throwing a !paralysation, grabbing whatever loot you want, and running away
    is a perfectly viable strategy. (*Just be prepared for unbreathing monsters
    that won't be affected by gases!*)

## Iron Vaults

- [What happens when you open an iron vault while
  unprepared](https://tilde.team/~kiedtl/images/rl/jul01-iron-vaults.png)

- Rusty walls.
- Recruits, defenders, javelineers, death knights, bone mages, iron and
  lightning spires.
- Rare chance of necromancers, war olgs, or warriors.
- Found on the lower levels.

## Golden Vaults

- Golden walls.
- Pure developer sadism. Imagine a room full of OOFs on D:12 in DCSS.
- Death mages and knights, warriors, destroyers, necromancers, war olgs, bloats,
  spires, brimstone and lightning mages, lead turtles, frozen fiends.
- Possibility of an Ancient Mage.
- Found on the upper levels.

## Marble Vaults

Marble treasure vault. Themed as the study/experimentation room of a death mage.

- Marble walls/doors.
- Generally, less dangerous than a Golden Room.
- Will always have a Death Mage band, next to some tables and chairs.
- May have some rows of corpses nearby for the Death Mage to use.
- Other undead monsters may occasionally occur. Bloats, skeletons, skeletal
  blademasters, calcite spires, etc.
- Possibility of an Ancient Mage.
- Found on the middle and upper levels.

## Taverns

Wooden rooms. Themed as a bar.

- Probably the least dangerous of all the treasure vault types.
- All the monsters have the `Drunk` status, causing their movement to be
  erratic.
- Tables, chairs, a bartender, etc.
- Found on the lower and middle levels.
